# DeepChat Version N - Migration Release Notes

## üöÄ Major Update: Database Migration to PGlite

This release introduces a significant architectural improvement by migrating from the current dual-database system (SQLite + DuckDB) to a unified PGlite-based solution. This change improves performance, reduces complexity, and provides a more maintainable architecture.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Migration Information

### Automatic Migration Process

When you first start this version of DeepChat, the application will automatically detect your existing databases and perform a one-time migration to the new PGlite format. This process:

- **Preserves all your data**: 100% of your conversations, messages, and knowledge base will be migrated
- **Creates automatic backups**: Your original databases are backed up before migration
- **Shows progress**: A progress dialog will keep you informed during the migration
- **Is reversible**: If needed, you can rollback to your previous data

### What to Expect

1. **First Startup**: The migration will begin automatically when you start the application
2. **Migration Time**: Depending on your data size, migration may take a few minutes
3. **Progress Display**: You'll see a progress dialog with estimated completion time
4. **Completion**: Once complete, the application will restart and function normally

### Data Safety

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Backups**: Original databases are backed up with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Migration includes integrity checks to ensure no data loss
- ‚úÖ **Rollback Support**: If issues occur, you can restore from backups
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery options

## üÜï New Features

### Unified Database Architecture
- **Single Database**: All data now stored in one PGlite database
- **Improved Performance**: Faster queries and reduced memory usage

## üìã System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: Additional 2x your current database size for migration
- **Disk Space**: At least 1GB free space for migration process

### Recommended for Large Databases

- **Disk Space**: 3x your current database size for safe migration

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Migration Fails to Start
**Symptoms**: Application starts but migration doesn't begin
**Solutions**:
1. Check available disk space (need 2x current database size)
2. Ensure application has write permissions to data directory
3. Close other applications that might be using database files
4. Restart application as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)

#### Migration Progress Stalls
**Symptoms**: Progress bar stops moving for extended periods
**Solutions**:
1. Be patient - large databases take time to migrate
2. Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
3. Close unnecessary applications to free up resources
4. If stalled for >30 minutes, restart and try again

#### Migration Fails with Error
**Symptoms**: Error dialog appears during migration
**Solutions**:
1. Note the error message and check troubleshooting guide
2. Ensure sufficient disk space and permissions
3. Try restarting the application to resume migration
4. If persistent, restore from backup and contact support

#### Application Won't Start After Migration
**Symptoms**: Application crashes or won't open after migration
**Solutions**:
1. Check application logs for error details
2. Verify PGlite database file integrity
3. Restore from backup if necessary
4. Reinstall application if database is corrupted

### Getting Help

## üîÑ Upgrade Path

### From Previous Versions
1. **Backup Recommended**: While automatic backups are created, manual backup is recommended
2. **Close Application**: Ensure DeepChat is completely closed before upgrading
3. **Install Update**: Install the new version normally
4. **First Launch**: Allow migration to complete on first startup
5. **Verify Data**: Check that all your conversations and knowledge base are intact

### For Large Databases
If you have large databases (>1GB):
1. **Plan Downtime**: Migration may take 30+ minutes
2. **Ensure Resources**: Close other applications during migration
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the progress dialog for updates
4. **Be Patient**: Large migrations take time but preserve all data

## üö® Important Notes
