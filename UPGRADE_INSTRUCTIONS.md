# DeepChat Version N - Upgrade Instructions

## üìã Pre-Upgrade Checklist

Before upgrading to Version N with PGlite migration, please complete the following steps:

### 1. System Requirements Check
- [ ] **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Ubuntu 18.04+
- [ ] **Available Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large databases)
- [ ] **Free Disk Space**: At least 2x your current database size + 1GB
- [ ] **Permissions**: Ensure you have write access to the application data directory

### 2. Data Preparation
- [ ] **Close DeepChat**: Ensure the application is completely closed
- [ ] **Manual Backup** (Recommended): Create a manual backup of your data directory
- [ ] **Check Database Size**: Note the size of your current databases for time estimation
- [ ] **Free Up Space**: Ensure adequate free disk space for migration

### 3. Environment Preparation
- [ ] **Close Other Apps**: Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources
- [ ] **Stable Power**: Ensure stable power supply (use UPS if available)
- [ ] **Network Connection**: Ensure stable internet connection for any required downloads
- [ ] **Administrator Access**: Have administrator/sudo access available if needed

## üöÄ Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. **Download Version N**
   - Visit the official DeepChat website or update through the application
   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system
   - Verify the download integrity if checksums are provided

2. **Install the Update**
   - **Windows**: Run the installer as administrator
   - **macOS**: Drag to Applications folder and authorize if prompted
   - **Linux**: Install using your package manager or run the AppImage

3. **First Launch Preparation**
   - Do not launch the application immediately after installation
   - Ensure all system requirements are still met
   - Close any antivirus real-time scanning temporarily if it interferes

### Step 2: Migration Process

1. **Launch DeepChat**
   - Start the application normally
   - The migration detection will begin automatically
   - Do not close the application during this process

2. **Migration Detection**
   - The application will scan for legacy databases
   - You'll see a dialog showing detected databases and estimated migration time
   - Review the information and click "Start Migration" when ready

3. **Migration Execution**
   - **Progress Monitoring**: Watch the progress dialog for updates
   - **Time Estimation**: Note the estimated completion time
   - **System Resources**: Monitor system performance during migration
   - **Patience Required**: Large databases may take 30+ minutes to migrate

4. **Migration Completion**
   - The application will restart automatically after successful migration
   - Verify that all your data is present and accessible
   - Check that all features work as expected

## ‚è±Ô∏è Migration Time Estimates

### Database Size Guidelines
- **Small** (< 100MB): 2-5 minutes
- **Medium** (100MB - 500MB): 5-15 minutes
- **Large** (500MB - 1GB): 15-30 minutes
- **Very Large** (> 1GB): 30+ minutes

### Factors Affecting Migration Time
- **Database Size**: Larger databases take longer
- **System Performance**: CPU, RAM, and disk speed impact migration time
- **Data Complexity**: More relationships and indexes increase migration time
- **System Load**: Other running applications can slow migration

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Migration Won't Start

**Problem**: Application starts but migration doesn't begin
**Solutions**:
1. Check that legacy databases exist in the expected location
2. Verify sufficient disk space (need 2x current database size)
3. Ensure application has write permissions to data directory
4. Restart application as administrator/sudo
5. Check application logs for error messages

### Insufficient Disk Space

**Problem**: Migration fails due to lack of disk space
**Solutions**:
1. Free up disk space by removing unnecessary files
2. Move large files to external storage temporarily
3. Use disk cleanup tools to free up system space
4. Consider migrating on a system with more available space

### Migration Stalls or Freezes

**Problem**: Progress bar stops moving for extended periods
**Solutions**:
1. **Be Patient**: Large databases legitimately take time
2. **Check System Resources**: Ensure adequate CPU, RAM, and disk I/O
3. **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources
4. **Wait 30 Minutes**: If no progress after 30 minutes, consider restart
5. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in application logs

### Migration Fails with Error

**Problem**: Error dialog appears during migration
**Solutions**:
1. **Note Error Message**: Record the exact error for troubleshooting
2. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure adequate space is still available
3. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure write access to all necessary directories
4. **Restart Migration**: Close and restart application to retry
5. **Restore Backup**: If persistent, restore from backup and contact support

### Application Won't Start After Migration

**Problem**: Application crashes or won't open after migration
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Logs**: Review application logs for error details
2. **Verify Database**: Check that PGlite database file exists and isn't corrupted
3. **Restore Backup**: Use automatic backups to restore previous state
4. **Reinstall**: If necessary, reinstall application and retry migration
5. **Contact Support**: Reach out with error details and log files

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
- Migration fails repeatedly with errors
- Data appears to be missing or corrupted after migration
- Application becomes unstable after migration
- Performance is significantly degraded

### How to Rollback

1. **Locate Backups**
   - Automatic backups are created in the application data directory
   - Look for timestamped backup folders created during migration
   - Verify backup integrity before proceeding

2. **Restore Previous Version**
   - Uninstall Version N
   - Reinstall the previous version of DeepChat
   - Restore database files from backup
   - Verify that all data is accessible

3. **Verify Restoration**
   - Check that all conversations and knowledge base are intact
   - Test all application features
   - Ensure performance is back to normal

## üìä Post-Migration Verification
